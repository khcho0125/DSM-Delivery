#### We used to construct servers with Kotlin, and our main framework was Spring Boot.

#### However, We can now move away from the framework called Spring Boot.

#### According to [Ktor documentation](https://ktor.io/docs/welcome.html) "Ktor is a framework for easily building connected applications."

#### In fact, the Ktor Framework is faster than Spring Boot.

#### It's my first time using Ktor, so I will make continuous efforts to achieve better clean code ðŸ§—
